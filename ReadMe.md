# Functions and Errors - ETH + AVAX Project

## Description
Through the require, revert, and assert functions, the MyErrH contract provides users with the ability to modify a numerical value, num. 

## Getting Started

### To successfully work with the project, you can use Remix. 

It is a no-setup smart contract development tool with a GUI.

### To execute the program 
https://remix.ethereum.org/ - go to this website

When you are already on the Remix website, click theÂ new file button, then use the.sol extension when saving the file.

Copy the code from the repository named MyErrH.sol

After copying the code, compile the code and deploy it and examine how the code works. 

A smart contract named MyErrH that runs on Solidity makes it possible to manipulate a number called num. 
assertFunc, revertFunc, and requireFunc are the three main functions provided in the contract.
